## Hello World

I start this blog because I recently become eagerly ethusiastic on writing about the following topics, including but are not limited to:

* Technicality and practicality and in between
* Wiener’s cybernetics and “modern” physical intelligence
* Series on diffusion and flows
* Optimal transport and Schroedinger bridge
* Series on control concepts inspiring learning
* Caratheodory and Einstein‘s gravity

I hope I can finish most of them one day!
