## Welcome to my Blog

I start this blog because I recently become eagerly ethusiastic on writing about the following topics:

* Series on diffusion and flows
* Series on control concepts inspiring learning
* Optimal transport and Schroedinger bridge
* Wiener’s cybernetics and “modern” physical intelligence
* Technicality, practicality, and in between
* Caratheodory and Einstein‘s gravity
* ...

I hope I can finish most of them one day!
